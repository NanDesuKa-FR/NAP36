~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
only one â€” the one from the certifi package.

If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.
